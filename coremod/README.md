Coremod for Quantum Skies modpack.
---

Currently this mod adds ULV covers. The intention is to replace pipez for early game automation and steer players into GT logistics earlier. 

It's not great to modify LV covers for this purpose, because they're used as crafting components in LV machines, so modifying their recipes affects balance.

The Pump/Regulator run at 32mb/t and the Conveyor/Robot Arm at 2 items/sec.
