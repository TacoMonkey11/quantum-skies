# Quantum Skies

Quantum skies is a GTCEu-modern based skyblock modpack.



Goals:

* "Classic" skyblock gameplay (ex nihilo)
* Beginner friendly questbook
* Tech-mod (esp GT) focus
* QOL mods (wireless power, fluid/item logistics)
* Reduced early-game grinding (ultimine, twerking, et al)

Inspiration:

* Agrarian Skies, the original expert skyblock
* Gregblock, the original gregtech skyblock
* Gregicality Skyblock, gtceu skyblock before gtceu exists
* Sky Technology, a gtceu modern skyblock
* Gregtech Community Pack (+Modern), great GT tutorial pack

Credits:

* Many GT oritned quest lines are adapted directly or inspired by GCP
* Lanthanides, Platinum chain are from GTNH via GTEC (may be adapted further over time)
